# 👋 Hi | नमस्ते | Olá | Salut | Nǐ hǎo !

I'm **Bala Balaji Venu Madhav**, an **Embedded Systems Developer** and **C programmer** with a passion for building practical, efficient solutions that bridge the gap between hardware and software. I specialize in **Embedded C**, **Microcontroller programming**, and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**, with a focus on resource-constrained environments.

## 🚀 Currently:
I’m actively seeking a **job opportunity** as an **Embedded Systems Engineer**, where I can leverage my skills in **C programming**, **Microcontroller development**, and **Embedded Systems** to contribute to impactful projects and continue growing professionally.

## 🎓 Education:
I graduated with a **Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)** from **SRKR Engineering College**, where I gained hands-on experience in **Embedded Systems** and hardware-software integration.

## 📚 Additional Learning:
I enhanced my skills in **C & C++ programming** and **Microcontroller development** through a focused training program at **Emertxe Information Technologies**, where I worked on real-world embedded solutions.

## 🔧 Skills & Technologies:

- **Languages**: C, Embedded C, Python, and C++ (with practical knowledge for embedded systems).
- **Microcontrollers**: Arduino, 8051, ESP32, PIC18F4580.
- **Embedded Systems**: Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS), Device Drivers, Interrupts, GPIO, Power Management.
- **Tools**: MPlabx, Git, Visual Studio Code.

## 💻 Projects:

- **Image Steganography** (Aug 2024):  
  Developed a system using **C** to securely encode and decode hidden messages within image files using the **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** technique. This project ensured minimal distortion to images while maintaining data integrity.

- **MP3 Tag Reader and Editor** (Aug 2024):  
  Created a command-line-based **MP3 tag reader/editor** in **C** to read, modify, and update metadata (such as title, artist, album, etc.) in MP3 files. Supported parsing and editing **ID3 v2.3 and 2.4 tags**.

- **Inverted Search** (Oct 2024):  
  Designed and implemented an **inverted search system** using advanced **DSA** in **C** to efficiently index and search through large datasets for text and document search applications.

- **Car Blackbox** (Sept 2024):  
  Developed a **car blackbox system** using **Embedded C** and the **PIC18F4580** microcontroller to monitor and record critical vehicle parameters like speed and time. The system stores data for post-incident review.

- **GSM-based Home Security System** (Date):  
  Designed a **GSM-based home security system** using the **8051 microcontroller** and **Embedded C**, integrating sensors like **PIR**, **door/window contacts**, and **gas sensors** to send SMS alerts for intrusion detection.

## 🌱 Current Focus:
I’m focused on securing a **full-time position** where I can contribute to innovative **Embedded Systems** projects and continue to refine my skills in **Microcontroller development**, **C programming**, and **Embedded Systems design**.

## 🎮 Fun Fact:
When I’m not coding, I enjoy watching **sports**, experimenting with **Indian cooking**, and exploring new **technologies**. I’m always up for a challenge and love **learning something new**! 😄
